# iObjects Security Service

This project is a fully functional security module developed for iObjects. Its functional requirements were based on Windows server security, which should cover some pretty exciting features, like:

- Roles
  - Schedule: days of the week and time of the day to allow user's access.
  - Objects and commands: where you can check every single object and its commands to allow user's access.
  - Companies: each company the user has access in a multi-company enviroment.
- Users
